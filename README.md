# The Handbook for Becoming a Planetary Scientist
### A Crowdsourced Resource for Students and Early Career Scientists

#### About the [handbook](handbook.md)
This is an open-source, crowdsourced document (not software, but perhaps even more useful). Much like a Wikipedia article, this is a living document (very much still in progress), so if you have anything to add, please consider contributing!

#### How-to

### About the authors
This is a crowd-sourced document, so it has many authors. Even the first draft that appears here was already edited in a google doc by several anonymous users. I had the idea for it while attending the IDEA sessions at LPSC 2023. I created a google doc with many headers and mostly empty sections, shared it in a few slack channels, some very lovely people jumped right in. If you were one of those first contributors, I am so grateful for your additions!
