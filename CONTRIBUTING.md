## A few guidelines for contributing to this project:

### Writing guidelines
- You’ll find sections in the document to help spark ideas. Feel free to add your thoughts and resources below any heading, or add a new heading. 
- Don’t worry about formatting, or how to organize information, or whether you’re duplicating something someone else already wrote—we'll make changes before merging if necessary.
- Don’t delete/write over something someone else wrote, even if you think it’s bad advice. Instead, share your differing advice, add an explanation if necessary, and allow the reader to make a decision.
- That said, keep it respectful and positive. 
- Avoid cynicism. Warnings can be helpful, but encouragement and support is better.

### Practical guidelines

- If you'd like to add to this handbook but don't have experience with git or github, this is a great way to practice! Here are some resources:
  - [How to make your first pull request on Github](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/)
  - Codeastro [Mechanics of Git and Gitflow lessons](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro/tree/main/Day2) (scroll down to the useful links and view the slides).
- When committing changes, please make a comment about which heading(s) you worked on, and if you edited existing text or added new text.
- Please review the license before submitting a pull request. Anything added to this project can be reused, but must be cited and licensed under a compatible license.
- If your changes are merged (i.e., published), you'll be added to the list of contributors (i.e., authors). If you wish instead to remain anonymous, please send me a message (@belindathemoon) with your suggested changes, and I can add them for you.
- This should go without saying, but just in case—no racism, sexism, ageism, ableism, nationalism, or other “isms”. Please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
