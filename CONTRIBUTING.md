## A few guidelines for contributing to this project:
- You’ll find sections in the document to help spark ideas. Feel free to add your thoughts and resources below any heading, or add a new heading. 
- Don’t worry about formatting, or how to organize information, or whether you’re duplicating something someone else already wrote—we'll make changes before committing if necessary.
- Don’t delete/write over something someone else wrote, even if you think it’s bad advice. Instead, share your differing advice, add an explanation if necessary, and allow the reader to make a decision.
- That said, keep it respectful and positive. 
- Avoid cynicism. Warnings can be helpful, but encouragement and support is better.
- This should go without saying, but just in case—no racism, sexism, ageism, ableism, nationalism, or other “isms”. Please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Please review the license before committing. Anything added to this project can be reused, but must be cited and licensed under a compatible license.
