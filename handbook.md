## For Undergraduate Students…

### What do you need to get into grad school for Planetary Science?

- Passion and enthusiasm
- Good references, from people who know you (a great recommendation from a new prof who knows you well is much better than a recommendation from a famous person who barely knows you)
- A solid Personal Statement
- An undergraduate degree in a physical science field (?)
- Research experience
- Conference presentation(s) (helpful but not required)
- A published paper (helpful but not required)
- Leadership experience (helpful but not required)
- Coding experience (useful for you, also helpful for getting research experience, not required)

### Getting Research Experience

- If you're at an institution where people are doing planetary research, you can often do research for course credit during the academic year, and get paid for doing research over the summer.
- If you’re at an institution that doesn’t have planetary research (or doesn’t have research at all) internships are usually the best way to get research experience, but if you want to work in a specific lab, you can always reach out to the PI and see if they need a research assistant.

#### Internships
For competitive internships like REUs, it's better to apply to a just a few of your top choices and spend a lot of time researching the faculty and program before writing a very targeted application. Check out this [Brief and Unofficial Guide to REU applications](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1XtJq3BwSUxvijCoJaxXdCcf5tH-t_EsWC-GgC7KCx2A), which is applicable beyond just REUs.

##### Part-time internships

- [NASA](https://intern.nasa.gov/) has semester-long internships that may be paid or for credit (they must be one or the other)
- At JPL, the MSP program is a flexible way for PIs to hire interns. If you're interested in working with someone, reach out to them before applying. For fall internships, reach out by June. For spring internships, reach out by October. For summer internships, reach out by the end of January. If you're not sure what to write, ask a mentor to help draft an email, or see the [Cold Calling](#Cold_Calling) section below
- If you are a community college student in California, you may be eligible to apply for [JPL SIRI](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/intern/apply/student-independent-research-intern/)

#### Cold calling

Cold calling is when you contact someone without an advertised opening. In this case, we're referring to emailing a researcher who does not have an advertised internship, but whom you'd like to work with. 

Before reaching out to someone cold, first see if you have a connection in your network. Ask your favorite professors, grad students you know, or other students who have done research at that institution. If you find a connection, ask them (very politely) for an introduction. Congrats! You're no longer cold-calling. 

If you don't have any connections, then follow this format:
1. Introduce yourself briefly with your full name, major, school, and your interest in doing research.
2. If you have any research experience, describe that briefly. If you've worked under a faculty member, mention their name or their lab.
3. Explain what about their research interests you and how it is important to your career. You should have spent at least a few hours reading about their research (their lab website, abstracts of their recently published work, any popular articles they've written, videos on youtube of talks they've given).
4. Ask if they have need of and room for a research assistant. If you have funding from an outside source (for example, an internship program at your school), or if you're happy to work unpaid for school credit, mention that.
5. Attach your CV and/or include a link to your online CV.

If you have a favorite professor or mentor, or even a trusted peer, ask if they'll take a look at your email before you send it!

### Presenting your work

### Applying to Graduate schools

- Before you apply to grad schools, you should reach out to potential advisors and see if they are looking for students, and if it’s a good fit for you
  - In your first email:
    - Introduce yourself (“My name is First Lastname, and I’m a senior at school studying major”)
    - Describe your (relevant) (or relevant-ish) research experience (don’t be afraid to name-drop! Planetary science is a fairly small community, so you’re probably connected to your potential advisors in some way)
    - Mention if you’ve presented at a conference or published something, and include a link to your abstract if possible
    - Link your current/past research to the kind of stuff you want to do in grad school ***in the prospective advisor’s lab***
    - Include a resume or CV
    - Ask if they’re taking students, and create opportunities for following up–ask if they’re available for a Zoom or phone call in the nearish future!
  - If they don’t reply within a week-ish, send a follow-up email! Professors get a lot of emails and it’s not unlikely that yours got lost. Do NOT send more than 1 or (rarely) 2 followup emails and do NOT mention how long it’s been since you sent your first email! Emphasize that you’re very interested in working with them, and expand a bit more on the reasons why.

#### How to choose a program

- Do the grad students seem happy? Do they have a healthy work-life balance? If they were applying to grad school now, would they choose the same program? (email them to ask them, or find out during a campus visit)
- How much do the grad students get paid? Can people live on that amount at that location? (The rule of thumb is that no more than 30% of your paycheck should to housing costs; if it does then this is called being "rent-burdened" or "cost-burdened". Unfortunately, this is very common for graduate students.)
- What’s the health insurance like? If you have medical issues, what’s the local medical situation like (will you have to travel to see specialists, etc.)?
- If this matters to you: is this a state that doesn’t allow universities to ban guns on campus? If you’re going to be a TA, are you comfortable with that?
- Is the project something you are excited about? Enough to do it for a few years? Will you have freedom to follow your own scientific questions? Will you work with a team or individually? 
- Make sure that there are at least two people in the department who would be good advisors for you. Three are better. Things can go wrong: you might not get along with your first choice advisor, they might not be taking students, they could move, they could die (hard to think about but it does happen), etc.
- Make sure there are also multiple projects that you are interested in working on (for similar reasons).
- Do the faculty have time for their students? If they are unavailable during visiting week, or you're unable to get time to talk to them before you have to make a decision, this is generally a bad sign. 
- Consider location, i.e., is it somewhere you will enjoy living for 5+ years? This is more important than you may think!
- Planetary programs vary widely, from geology-based to astronomy-based. Does the program suit your background and what you want to learn? What are the requirements? 
- Are you required to teach? Is financial support guaranteed? If so, is it based on teaching or research? 
- If this matters to you: are the graduate students unionized? Are the faculty unionized? How good are the health benefits?
- How diverse is the student population? How diverse is the faculty population? Will you feel comfortable and supported? (You may have to talk to current students to find out)
- What do the graduate students go on to do after they graduate (especially your prospective advisor's students)? Ask the faculty what their graduated students are doing now. Speak to graduates of the program. Does this align with your career goals? 

##### How to find an advisor

- Talk to your undergraduate advisor(s). Do they have any suggestions for schools they think would be good for you, and/or people they’d recommend that you work with? Can they introduce you to anyone?
- Read literature in the areas in which you’re interested and see what names come up often (may be third, fourth author)
- Go to conferences
- Speak to grad students and recent grads that are doing work similar to what you’d like to do
- Twitter! Many professors love twitter
- [AAS DPS graduate program listing](https://dps.aas.org/education/graduate-schools) (incomplete and often out of date, but a good starting place) 

##### How to choose an advisor

- Are they currently accepting students? Most advisors don’t take on new grad students every year.
- Do they have funding? Will they be able to support you as a student?
- Ask about previous students, where have they gone, what are they doing now
- Ask about communication style and expectations for how much time you’ll get with them, and how much time they expect you to work (work-life balance is important)
- Do they have time for you? (See above in How to Choose a Program)
- Do they expect you to teach? Will they allow you to teach? Do the answers to these questions fit into your career hopes/plans?
- What is their group like? Will you be working on your own, or with others? Do you think you’d like working with those people?
- Will you work on your own project or a subset of their work?
- Speak to their current and former students
- Are you comfortable talking with them? It's important that you get along with (and like) your advisor. You will need them to be writing (good) letters for you for many years even after you graduate.
- Ask what kinds of skills their students learn that might generalize (this can be helpful for securing post-doc positions or other employment post-graduation).
