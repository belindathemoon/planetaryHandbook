## For Undergraduate Students…

**Update for 2025:** While most of the advice below is still relevant and useful, the current landscape of funding and the hostile position taken by the executive branch of the federal government toward federal funding agencies (and science in general), makes this an especially difficult time to enter into a field of academic research. The policies have been changing often, both for worse and for better, and funding is up in the air for many PIs (primary investigators). This makes it that much more important to reach out to potential advisors before applying so that you understand their funding situation. They may not have funding for you, but they may know someone who does. Everyone is especially reliant on their networks and right now, so don't be afraid to ask for help! This is a time where communities and mutual support is the only way forward.

### What do you need to get into grad school for Planetary Science?

- Passion and enthusiasm
- Good references, from people who know you (a great recommendation from a new prof who knows you well is much better than a recommendation from a famous person who barely knows you)
- A solid Personal Statement
- An undergraduate degree in a physical science field (maybe—[see more below](#nontraditional-students-&amp-students-changing-fields))
- [Research experience](#getting-research-experience)
- Conference presentation(s) (helpful but not required)
- Leadership experience (helpful but not required)
- Coding experience (useful for you, also helpful for getting research experience, not required)
- A published paper (helpful but definitely not required)

### Getting Research Experience

- If you're at an institution where people are doing planetary research, you can often do research for course credit during the academic year, and get paid for doing research over the summer.
- If you’re at an institution that doesn’t have planetary research (or doesn’t have research at all) internships are usually the best way to get research experience, but if you want to work in a specific lab, you can always reach out to the PI and see if they need a research assistant.

#### Internships
For competitive internships like REUs, it's better to apply to a just a few of your top choices and spend a lot of time researching the faculty and program before writing a very targeted application. Check out this [Brief and Unofficial Guide to REU applications](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1XtJq3BwSUxvijCoJaxXdCcf5tH-t_EsWC-GgC7KCx2A), which is applicable beyond just REUs.

##### Part-time internships

- [NASA](https://intern.nasa.gov/) has semester-long internships that may be paid or for credit (they must be one or the other)
- At JPL, the MSP program is a flexible way for PIs to hire interns. If you're interested in working with someone, reach out to them before applying. For fall internships, reach out by June. For spring internships, reach out by October. For summer internships, reach out by the end of January. If you're not sure what to write, ask a mentor to help draft an email, or see the [Cold Calling](#Cold_Calling) section below
- If you are a community college student in California, you may be eligible to apply for [JPL SIRI](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/intern/apply/student-independent-research-intern/)

#### Cold calling

Cold calling is when you contact someone without an advertised opening. In this case, we're referring to emailing a researcher who does not have an advertised internship, but whom you'd like to work with. 

Before reaching out to someone cold, first see if you have a connection in your network. Ask your favorite professors, grad students you know, or other students who have done research at that institution. If you find a connection, ask them (very politely) for an introduction. Congrats! You're no longer cold-calling. 

If you don't have any connections, then follow this format:
1. Introduce yourself briefly with your full name, major, school, and your interest in doing research.
2. If you have any research experience, describe that briefly. If you've worked under a faculty member, mention their name or their lab.
3. Explain what about their research interests you and how it is important to your career. You should have spent at least a few hours reading about their research (their lab website, abstracts of their recently published work, any popular articles they've written, videos on youtube of talks they've given).
4. Ask if they have need of and room for a research assistant. If you have funding from an outside source (for example, an internship program at your school), or if you're happy to work unpaid for school credit, mention that.
5. Attach your CV and/or include a link to your online CV.

If you have a favorite professor or mentor, or even a trusted peer, ask if they'll take a look at your email before you send it!

### Applying to Graduate schools

- Before you apply to grad schools, you should reach out to potential advisors and see if they are looking for students, and if it’s a good fit for you
  - In your first email:
    - Introduce yourself (“My name is First Lastname, and I’m a senior at school studying major”)
    - Describe your (relevant) (or relevant-ish) research experience (don’t be afraid to name-drop! Planetary science is a fairly small community, so you’re probably connected to your potential advisors in some way)
    - Mention if you’ve presented at a conference or published something, and include a link to your abstract if possible
    - Link your current/past research to the kind of stuff you want to do in grad school ***in the prospective advisor’s lab***
    - Include a resume or CV
    - Ask if they’re taking students, and create opportunities for following up–ask if they’re available for a Zoom or phone call in the nearish future!
  - If they don’t reply within a week-ish, send a follow-up email! Professors get a lot of emails and it’s not unlikely that yours got lost. Do NOT send more than 1 or (rarely) 2 followup emails and do NOT mention how long it’s been since you sent your first email! Emphasize that you’re very interested in working with them, and expand a bit more on the reasons why.

#### Nontraditional students & students changing fields

It is of course easier to follow the traditional path: from a geology or astronomy undergraduate degree at a research university straight into a PhD program. But that is only because that path is well-trod and clearly laid out. There are in fact many pathways to become a planetary scientist, and planetary scientists on the whole come from more diverse backgrounds than a lot of other natural science disciplines. One of the great things about planetary science is that it is interdisciplinary by definition (only recently have universities included it as an area of study—many senior researchers still in the field were originally cobbling together a research program from multiple departments). There are also a lot of artists in planetary science, so whatever your background is, know that your application is not going to be set aside just because of your undergraduate major.

Here are a few tips for those on a nontraditional path:
- You do need *an* undergraduate degree to apply for graduate programs, but (generally) it doesn't need to be in the same field.
  - Check with the programs that you're interested in to understand their specific requirements. For example, at Johns Hopkins University, the only requirement is that you have an undergraduate degree, however at University of Hawaii, a degree in physics or geology (or the equivalent coursework) is required to apply for the planetary geology PhD. The department chair and/or your prospective advisor can help you find this criteria.
  - It helps to have some coursework in geology, physics, or chemistry, but it doesn't have to be a full degree's worth. Because planetary science departments are interdisciplinary, most of the students will be coming in with a variety of backgrounds, so you won't be the only one coming in who doesn't know anything about a certain topic.
  - Astronomy & Physics departments are generally, but not always, more strict about academic backgrounds than Earth & Planetary Science or Geology & Planetary Science departments. Often, the students come from less diverse background in the former than the latter two, so this may also be something you want to consider.
- Research goes a long way for making up for a lack of coursework. Even one good research experience, like a full-time summer internship, can be enough to put you ahead of other applicants that got straight-A's in a Physics undergraduate degree but didn't do much research.
- Your personal statement will be a big part of your application—make sure to lean in to why your nontraditional path makes you more, rather than less, prepared to go into a PhD program. For example:
  - You have had more life experience and you know this is what you want and why you're doing it.
  - You have transferable skills from your work or non-science experience that will benefit you in your academic career (e.g., time management skills, people skills, writing skills, ability to give and receive feedback/critique).
  - You have a clear career plan.
- When you reach out to potential advisors, include a sentence or two saying that you are a nontraditional student and describing your background, in addition to including your relevant research experience and what coursework/related degree you have done. If they are not interested in working with you because of your background, they would not be a good advisor anyway!
- Ask for advice and guidance from current grad students who are both from a traditional and nontraditional background. Try to glean what common experiences they might all have that helped to get them into their program. 

#### How to choose a program

- Do the grad students seem happy? Do they have a healthy work-life balance? If they were applying to grad school now, would they choose the same program? (email them to ask them, or find out during a campus visit)
- How much do the grad students get paid? Can people live on that amount at that location? (The rule of thumb is that no more than 30% of your paycheck should to housing costs; if it does then this is called being "rent-burdened" or "cost-burdened". Unfortunately, this is very common for graduate students.)
- What’s the health insurance like? If you have medical issues, what’s the local medical situation like (will you have to travel to see specialists, etc.)?
- If this matters to you: is this a state that doesn’t allow universities to ban guns on campus? If you’re going to be a TA, are you comfortable with that?
- Is the project something you are excited about? Enough to do it for a few years? Will you have freedom to follow your own scientific questions? Will you work with a team or individually? 
- Make sure that there are at least two people in the department who would be good advisors for you. Three are better. Things can go wrong: you might not get along with your first choice advisor, they might not be taking students, they could move, they could die (hard to think about but it does happen), etc.
- Make sure there are also multiple projects that you are interested in working on (for similar reasons).
- Do the faculty have time for their students? If they are unavailable during visiting week, or you're unable to get time to talk to them before you have to make a decision, this is generally a bad sign. 
- Consider location, i.e., is it somewhere you will enjoy living for 5+ years? This is more important than you may think!
- Planetary programs vary widely, from geology-based to astronomy-based. Does the program suit your background and what you want to learn? What are the requirements? 
- Are you required to teach? Is financial support guaranteed? If so, is it based on teaching or research? 
- If this matters to you: are the graduate students unionized? Are the faculty unionized? How good are the health benefits?
- How diverse is the student population? How diverse is the faculty population? Will you feel comfortable and supported? (You may have to talk to current students to find out)
- What do the graduate students go on to do after they graduate (especially your prospective advisor's students)? Ask the faculty what their graduated students are doing now. Speak to graduates of the program. Does this align with your career goals? 

##### How to find an advisor

- Talk to your undergraduate advisor(s). Do they have any suggestions for schools they think would be good for you, and/or people they’d recommend that you work with? Can they introduce you to anyone?
- Read literature in the areas in which you’re interested and see what names come up often (may be third, fourth author)
- Go to conferences
- Speak to grad students and recent grads that are doing work similar to what you’d like to do
- Twitter! Many professors love twitter
- [AAS DPS graduate program listing](https://dps.aas.org/education/graduate-schools) (incomplete and often out of date, but a good starting place) 

##### How to choose an advisor

- Are they currently accepting students? Most advisors don’t take on new grad students every year.
- Do they have funding? Will they be able to support you as a student?
- Ask about previous students, where have they gone, what are they doing now
- Ask about communication style and expectations for how much time you’ll get with them, and how much time they expect you to work (work-life balance is important)
- Do they have time for you? (See above in How to Choose a Program)
- Do they expect you to teach? Will they allow you to teach? Do the answers to these questions fit into your career hopes/plans?
- What is their group like? Will you be working on your own, or with others? Do you think you’d like working with those people?
- Will you work on your own project or a subset of their work?
- Speak to their current and former students
- Are you comfortable talking with them? It's important that you get along with (and like) your advisor. You will need them to be writing (good) letters for you for many years even after you graduate.
- Ask what kinds of skills their students learn that might generalize (this can be helpful for securing post-doc positions or other employment post-graduation).
- Also know that it is ok and normal to switch advisors while in grad school. If you are in an unhelpful or toxic environment, it is better to switch to another advisor, even if the research isn't exactly what you want to do. It is unlikely that this will impact the time it takes you to complete the PhD (it might even make the time shorter!).

### Postdoc fellowships

Post-doc fellowships are generally (but not always) required in order to be considered for a faculty position, and often helpful for getting into a competitive position in NASA or similar institutions. That said, it's not the end of the world if you don't get a post-doc. There are still many jobs within research institutions that are open to you. One example is the Space Telescope Science Institute.

If it's really important to you to get a post-doc, there are some things you can do while in graduate school to make yourself more competitive:

- While you're working on your schoolwork, and later your research, make sure to gain hands-on experience with useful software and other transferable skills, such as Python, data acquisition systems, hardware design programs (like autoCAD or similar). 
- Make sure you have demonstrated soft skills: project management, resourcefulness, people management, mentorship
- Get experience supervising other students, such as undergraduate mentorship leadership and supervising junior graduate students.
- Show that you are self-sufficient and can lead a project.
- Individual post-doc programs look for different things, so start looking at potential programs of interest before your last year, in case you need to gain additional skills or experience before applying
- Networking is important. Present your work often; make sure people know your name.
- If it's relevant, you can take a summer off from your PhD to do an internship in industry or at an institution of interest.
